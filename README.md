Environment

Watch: npm run watch 

	webpack watches for .js files and coverts any ES6 to ES5 syntax via babel loader.  

	run watch as "npm run watch". This uses Parallelshell package to watch multiple files (css and html)

Build: npm run build

	"npm run build" makes a build folder with html, css.min, and js.min (via babel). 

	index.less - use LESS syntax and the build will convert to a CSS syntax. 

Initially only used for front-end work. Does not have server.js folder for server rendering.
